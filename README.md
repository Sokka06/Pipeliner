# Pipeliner
Pipeliner helps you execute important sequences, such as initializing social services, loading savegames, loading scenes, level generation and more using custom made **Steps**.

## Getting started
1. Clone or download repository.
2. Copy **Pipeliner** folder from **Plugins** folder to your project.
3. Take a look at the included *Demos*.
4. Done!

Developed in **Unity 2020.3.23f1**, but I don't see why it wouldn't work in any Unity version.
